This MATLAB code can be used to model the spin dynamics of spin-3/2 nuclei using irreducible spherical tensor operators (ISTOs).

Code for simulation of 23Na Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) sequences is presented. Both a CPU and a GPU-accelerated version are available.


Thanks to Arthur Magill, on whose work this code is based on: https://github.com/arthurmagill/isto_sim
